# 0.0.2 - 10/16/2024
### App Changes
- Renamed "extension(s)" files, to "integration(s)".
- Added button effects & main color pattern on `App.css` as `.integration-item button`

### Notes
- No actual installation has been added, since i rather implement a verification for each integration that is added, before making it available. But i decided to publish the interface done so far, to show that the project is not abandoned/deprecated.
